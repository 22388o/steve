% Steve Runtime Configuration 
%   The Steve RC file needs to contain the format of requests handled by this
%   system, as well as the ability of this current system. Please see the 
%   documentation for examples.


% THE REQUEST FORMAT, NOT ALL OF THESE ARE REQUIRED.
{requests, [
    
    % Task the system will handle; building, runing, build then run.
        { task, required, [ "build", "run", "build&run" ] },

    % The desired result; compiled result, shell output, or all.
        { desire, required, [ "res", "out", "all" ] },

    % OS type
        { os, [ "win", "osx", "linux", "bsd" ] },
    
    % OS version
        { osv, version },

    % Architecture
        { arch, ["x86", "x86_64", "arm"] }, 

    % Executables required, list of tuples: {execname, version}
        { exec, lowercase },

    % Library List, list of tuples: {libary name, version}
        { lib, { {"name",lowercase}, 
                 {"version",version} } }

]}.


% THE CAPABILITY LIST OF THIS MACHINE.

        {os, "linux"},
        {osv, ["3.5.*","ubuntu"]},
